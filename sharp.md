## Classes

    public:
        Use public when you want the class or its members to be accessible from any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
        Example: public class MyClass { ... }
        This is commonly used for classes that form the public API of a library or framework.

    private:
        private is used when you want the members of a class to be accessible only within the same class.
        Example: private int myPrivateField;
        This is the default access level for class members. It's used to encapsulate the internal state of the class.

    protected:
        Use protected for class members you want to make accessible only within the class itself and by derived classes.
        Example: protected void MyProtectedMethod() { ... }
        This is ideal for methods and properties that should be available to child classes but not to the rest of the application.

    internal:
        internal classes or members are accessible within the same assembly, but not from other assemblies.
        Example: internal class MyInternalClass { ... }
        This is useful for internal workings of a framework or library where you want to limit access to the assembly.

    protected internal:
        This combination allows access to the class or its members within the same assembly or in derived classes in other assemblies.
        Example: protected internal int MyVar;
        Itâ€™s less commonly used but can be helpful in specific scenarios where you need a wider access range than protected but more restricted than public.

    private protected:
        This combination limits access to the containing class or types derived from the containing class within the current assembly.
        Example: private protected int MyVar;
        It's useful when you want to allow access to derived classes but only within the same assembly.

    No Modifier (Default for classes):
        When no access modifier is specified for a class, it defaults to internal.
        Example: class MyClass { ... }
        This means the class is accessible within the same assembly but not from outside.
